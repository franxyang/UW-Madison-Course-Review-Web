## 🔄 In Progress (0/6)

These documents need English translation:

### Priority 1: Critical
- [ ] docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md
  - Current: Chinese (中文)
  - Length: ~300 lines
  - Complexity: Medium
  - Estimated time: 1-2 hours

### Priority 2: Important
- [ ] docs/PRODUCT_DESIGN.md (formerly wiscflow完整设计方案.md)
  - Current: Chinese (中文)
  - Length: ~500 lines
  - Complexity: High
  - Estimated time: 3-4 hours
  
- [ ] docs/TECH_UPGRADE_PLAN.md
  - Current: Chinese (中文)
  - Length: ~400 lines
  - Complexity: High
  - Estimated time: 2-3 hours

### Priority 3: Reference Docs
- [ ] docs/EVALUATION_REPORT.md
  - Current: Chinese (中文)
  - Length: ~350 lines
  - Complexity: Medium
  - Estimated time: 2 hours

- [ ] docs/MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md
  - Current: Chinese (中文)
  - Length: ~600 lines
  - Complexity: Medium
  - Estimated time: 3-4 hours

- [ ] docs/FILTER_IMPLEMENTATION.md
  - Current: Chinese (中文)
  - Length: ~300 lines
  - Complexity: Medium
  - Estimated time: 2 hours

---

## ⏸️ Low Priority (Can Keep Chinese or Translate Later)

These are less critical for GitHub:

- [ ] docs/MIGRATION_COMPLETED.md (needs sanitization anyway)
- [ ] docs/SUPABASE_VS_NEON.md (technical comparison, code-heavy)
- [ ] docs/SESSION_SUMMARY_2026-02-03.md (internal session note)

---

## 🔒 Keep in Chinese (Internal Use Only)

These are NOT for GitHub upload:

- .ai-context/CURRENT_STATE.md ✅ (AI context - Chinese is clearer)
- .ai-context/COMMIT_SUMMARY.md ✅ (AI context - Chinese is clearer)
- PROGRESS.md.zh ✅ (Chinese backup)
- CHANGELOG.md.zh ✅ (Chinese backup)

## 🛠️ Translation Strategy

### Option 1: Manual Translation (Most Accurate)
- Pros: Best quality, maintains technical accuracy
- Cons: Time-consuming (~15-20 hours total)
- Recommendation: For critical docs (Priority 1-2)

### Option 2: AI-Assisted Translation (Faster)
- Tools: Claude, ChatGPT, DeepL
- Process:
  1. Copy Chinese text
  2. Ask AI to translate to professional English
  3. Review and refine
  4. Commit
- Pros: Much faster (~5-8 hours total)
- Cons: Requires review for accuracy
- Recommendation: For reference docs (Priority 3)

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
- Priority 1: Manual translation (critical, user-facing)
- Priority 2-3: AI-assisted with manual review
- Estimated total time: ~8-10 hours

## 📝 Translation Checklist

For each document, ensure:

- [ ] Technical terms remain in English (e.g., "PostgreSQL", "tRPC")
- [ ] Code examples unchanged
- [ ] Professional, clear English
- [ ] No sensitive information
- [ ] Consistent terminology across documents
- [ ] Proper grammar and spelling

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Translate docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md

1. **Read the original**:
   ```bash
   cat docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md
   ```

2. **Create English version**:
   ```bash
   # Option A: Manual translation
   code docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP_EN.md
   
   # Option B: AI-assisted
   # Copy content → Ask Claude/ChatGPT to translate
   # Save to docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP_EN.md
   ```

3. **Review and replace**:
   ```bash
   # Backup Chinese version
   mv docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md.zh
   
   # Use English version
   mv docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP_EN.md docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md
   ```

4. **Commit**:
   ```bash
   git add docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md
   git commit -m "docs: translate PROJECT_ROADMAP to English"
   ```

## 💡 Tips for Efficient Translation

1. **Use consistent terminology**:
   - 学院 → School/College
   - 系 → Department
   - 课程 → Course
   - 评价 → Review
   - 评分 → Rating

2. **Keep code blocks unchanged**:
   - Don't translate variable names
   - Don't translate comments in code

3. **Maintain formatting**:
   - Keep markdown structure
   - Preserve tables, lists, code blocks

4. **Test links after translation**:
   - Ensure internal links still work
   - Update file references if needed
