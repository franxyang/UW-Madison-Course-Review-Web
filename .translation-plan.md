# Translation Plan for Public Documentation

## Priority 1: Critical (Now)
- [x] README.md - Already in English ✅
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md - Needs translation
- [ ] PROGRESS.md - Needs translation  
- [ ] docs/README.md - Needs translation

## Priority 2: Important (Next)
- [ ] docs/PRODUCT_DESIGN.md (wiscflow完整设计方案.md)
- [ ] docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md
- [ ] docs/TECH_UPGRADE_PLAN.md

## Priority 3: Reference Docs
- [ ] docs/EVALUATION_REPORT.md
- [ ] docs/MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md
- [ ] docs/MIGRATION_COMPLETED.md
- [ ] docs/FILTER_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- [ ] docs/SUPABASE_VS_NEON.md
- [ ] docs/SESSION_SUMMARY_2026-02-03.md

## Keep in Chinese (Internal Use)
- .ai-context/CURRENT_STATE.md ✅
- .ai-context/COMMIT_SUMMARY.md ✅

## Strategy
1. Translate critical docs first (Priority 1)
2. Create English versions with cleaner, more professional language
3. Remove overly detailed internal notes
4. Keep technical terms in English (e.g., "tRPC", "PostgreSQL")
