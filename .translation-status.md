## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### Option A: Continue Manual Translation (Most Accurate)
**Pros**: Best quality, full control  
**Cons**: Time-consuming  
**Time**: ~15-20 hours total

```bash
# Translate one doc at a time
1. docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md (1-2 hours)
2. docs/PRODUCT_DESIGN.md (3-4 hours)
3. docs/TECH_UPGRADE_PLAN.md (2-3 hours)
4. Remaining docs (8-10 hours)
```

### Option B: AI-Assisted Translation (Faster) ⭐ Recommended
**Pros**: Much faster, still good quality  
**Cons**: Requires careful review  
**Time**: ~5-8 hours total

```bash
# Use Claude/ChatGPT to translate
1. Copy Chinese content
2. Prompt: "Translate this technical documentation to 
   professional English. Keep code examples, technical 
   terms, and markdown formatting unchanged."
3. Review translation
4. Make corrections
5. Commit
```

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (Best Balance)
**Pros**: Fast + High Quality  
**Cons**: Requires judgment on what to manually translate  
**Time**: ~8-10 hours total

```
Priority 1: Manual translation (critical, user-facing)
Priority 2-3: AI-assisted with manual review
```
