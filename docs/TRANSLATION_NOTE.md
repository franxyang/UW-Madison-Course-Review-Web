# Translation Status

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-04 00:00 CST

## Fully Translated (English)
- ✅ README.md
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md
- ✅ PROGRESS.md
- ✅ docs/README.md
- ✅ docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md

## Partially Translated (Core English, Details TBD)
The following documents have English titles, headers, and key sections.
Detailed technical content and code examples remain as-is.

Chinese backups available as `*.md.zh` files.

- ⏳ docs/FILTER_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- ⏳ docs/EVALUATION_REPORT.md
- ⏳ docs/TECH_UPGRADE_PLAN.md
- ⏳ docs/MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md
- ⏳ docs/MIGRATION_COMPLETED.md
- ⏳ docs/SUPABASE_VS_NEON.md

## Translation Strategy
- Headers and sections: ✅ English
- Key descriptions: ✅ English  
- Code blocks: Preserved as-is
- Detailed procedures: Bilingual or TBD

This approach ensures docs are immediately usable while maintaining technical accuracy.
Full translation can be completed incrementally.

**Note**: All public-facing documentation is GitHub-ready.
Internal `.ai-context/` files remain in Chinese for accuracy.
